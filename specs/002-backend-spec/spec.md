## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Authenticate and Manage Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a registered user, I want to securely log in to the system and manage my personal tasks so that I can organize my work and personal life effectively.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the application - users need to authenticate and manage their tasks. Without this, the application has no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with valid credentials and performing CRUD operations on tasks. Delivers the core value of task management with proper user isolation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is logged in with valid JWT token, **When** user creates a new task, **Then** task is saved with user's ID and accessible only to that user
2. **Given** user has existing tasks, **When** user updates a task, **Then** only the authenticated user can modify their own tasks

---

### User Story 2 - Search and Filter Tasks (Priority: P2)

As a user with many tasks, I want to search and filter my tasks by various criteria so that I can quickly find what I need.

**Why this priority**: This enhances usability significantly for users who have many tasks, making the application more valuable for long-term use.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple tasks with different properties and verifying search/filter functionality works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has multiple tasks with different priorities, **When** user filters by priority, **Then** only tasks with the selected priority are displayed
2. **Given** user has tasks with various titles, **When** user searches by keyword, **Then** only tasks with matching titles or descriptions are returned

---

### User Story 3 - Set Task Properties (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to set various properties for my tasks (priority, due date, tags, recurrence) so that I can better organize and track them.

**Why this priority**: This adds significant value to the basic task management by allowing users to customize their tasks with important metadata.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating tasks with different properties and verifying they are stored and retrieved correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user creates a task, **When** user sets priority, due date, tags, and recurrence, **Then** all properties are saved and accessible
2. **Given** user has recurring tasks, **When** recurrence period passes, **Then** new task instance is created according to recurrence rules

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to access another user's tasks?
- How does system handle invalid JWT tokens?
- What occurs when a user exceeds title character limits?
- How does the system handle malformed date formats?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate users via JWT tokens using BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract user_id from JWT token and enforce user ownership on all operations
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide full CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- **FR-005**: System MUST support enhanced task properties: priority, tags, due date, recurrence
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate all input data (title length, priority values, recurrence values, due_date format)
- **FR-007**: System MUST return appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for invalid input, 401 for invalid token, 403 for cross-user access, 404 for missing tasks)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support search and filtering capabilities for tasks
- **FR-009**: System MUST support sorting capabilities for tasks
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce user isolation - users cannot access other users' tasks

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task**: Represents a user's task with properties like title, description, completion status, priority, tags, due date, and recurrence
- **User**: Represents an authenticated user identified by user_id extracted from JWT token
- **Authentication Token**: JWT token used for authenticating users and extracting user identity

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can authenticate with JWT tokens and perform all CRUD operations on their own tasks in under 3 seconds response time
- **SC-002**: System enforces user isolation with 100% accuracy - users cannot access other users' tasks
- **SC-003**: 95% of API requests return successful responses (2xx or 4xx, not 5xx) under normal load conditions
- **SC-004**: All input validation requirements are met with appropriate error responses returned for invalid inputs
- **SC-005**: Search, filter, and sort functionality works correctly for all supported parameters
